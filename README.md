# Cyber Security Internship – Task 8

## Task Title
SQL Injection Practical Exploitation (Analysis)

## Objective
To understand how SQL Injection vulnerabilities occur, how automated tools like SQLMap identify them, and how such vulnerabilities can be prevented.

## Vulnerability Covered
- SQL Injection (SQLi)

## Tools Studied
- SQLMap (conceptual)
- DVWA / OWASP Juice Shop (intentionally vulnerable applications)

## Work Performed
- Studied SQL Injection vulnerability and its working
- Identified injectable URL parameters
- Learned how SQLMap automates SQL Injection testing
- Analyzed potential database enumeration techniques
- Studied the impact of SQL Injection attacks

## Impact of SQL Injection
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- Exposure of user credentials
- Database modification or deletion
- Complete system compromise

## Mitigation Techniques
- Prepared statements
- Parameterized queries
- Input validation and sanitization
- Least privilege database access
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)

## Deliverables
- SQL Injection Analysis Report (PDF)
